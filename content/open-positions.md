### Postdoctoral Researchers in Formal Methods and Control Theory for AI-Intensive Cyber-Physical Systems (max. until March 2026)

(Posted at March 1, 2024)

We are excited to announce the availability of three postdoctoral researcher positions within the "CyPhAI: Formal Analysis and Design of AI-intensive Cyber-Physical Systems" project. We seek to develop mathematically rigorous methodologies for the modeling, verification, testing, monitoring, and control of cyber-physical systems (CPS) where artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role. This pioneering project is a collaborative effort between Japan teams led by Prof. Kohei Suenaga (Kyoto University) and Prof. Masako Kishida (NII) and the France team led by Prof. Thao Dang (CNRS), emphasizing international collaboration and interdisciplinary research in AI-CPS.

In this project, you will help advance the research in formal methods and control theories for AI-CPS and closely work with the leading researchers in Japan, Prof. Kohei Suenaga at Kyoto University in Kyoto or Prof. Masako Kishida at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in Tokyo. You will also have opportunities to participate in several annual project workshops held in France or Japan to collaborate with the France team as well as other Japan teams.

Candidates must have or be near the completion of a PhD with research in relevant fields and demonstrate a track record of research publications, conference presentations, and software programming skills. Research experience in interdisciplinary collaborations is highly valued. The positions are heavily research-oriented. Selected candidates will be expected to independently conduct research tasks including but not limited to the following:
- Propose and execute research plans
- Present progress and discuss with team members and collaborators regularly
- Prepare submissions to top-tier journals or conferences
- Promote our research outcome at international venues

We welcome applications from foreign (non-Japanese) nationals. This project is funded by the Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) program from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Positions are to be filled on a rolling basis with flexible start dates. The initial contract will end at March 2025 with the possibility of extension up to March 2026, when the project will conclude. Compensation is determined on the basis of your qualifications according to the employment regulations in Kyoto University or NII, with social insurances covered by the hiring institutions.

Compensation for successful candidate starts from 6M JPY/year before tax. (We would like to remark that living cost in Japan is quite low these days: Big-mac with fries and soda in McDonald's is 750 JPY; you can have decent ramen with 1000 JPY.)
