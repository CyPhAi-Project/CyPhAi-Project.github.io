**Formal Analysis and Design of AI-intensive Cyber-Physical Systems â€“ CyphAI** is a 5.5-year research project focusing on mathematically rigorous methodologies for the modeling, verification, testing, monitoring, and control of cyber-physical systems (CPS) where artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role.
This is a collaborative effort between Japan teams led by Prof. Kohei Suenaga (Kyoto University) and Prof. Masako Kishida (NII) and the France teams led by Prof. Thao Dang (CNRS), emphasizing international collaboration and interdisciplinary research in AI-CPS.
The project is supported by the Japan Science and Technology agency (JST) and Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR) through the Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) program.
